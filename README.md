# aria-workshop

Examples for internal developer workshop showing how semantic markup and aria attributes improve accessibility and screen reader experience.

[Node package manager](https://www.npmjs.com) is used for `npm install`, which in this case installs [Vue.js](https://github.com/vuejs/vue). This framework is then used to create the components for each example. 

Each HTML-file shows a bad example, not optimal for accessibility and screen readers. Change the component name from `-fail` to `-win` in each HTML example file to see the improved solution. The solutions are not made to be complete or perfect, but to focus on showing one or two improvements per example. More documentation later...
