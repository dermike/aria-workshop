# aria-workshop

Examples for internal developer workshop showing how semantic markup and aria attributes improve accessibility and screen reader experience.

`npm install` installs [Vue.js](https://github.com/vuejs/vue), which is used to create the components for each example. 

Each HTML-file shows a bad example, not optimal for accessibility and screen readers. Change the component name from `-fail` to `-win` in each HTML example file to see the improved solution. More documentation later...
